# Cookiecutter Data Science for VSCode Extension

The following template presents an iteration coming from the cookie
cutter template and includes the key building blocks for making experiments
for DVC VSCode extension. 

Some of the cookie cutter template features have been dropped out for
simplicity.


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.

│
├── setup.py           <- makes project pip installable (pip install -e .) so src can be imported
├── src                <- Source code for use in this project.

└── params.yaml        <- define the hyperparameters we want to iterate from that will be useful for the table

### Installing development requirements
------------

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the tests
------------

    py.test tests


### DVC 
------------

DVC Pipelines
For defining [stages](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/pipelines/defining-pipelines#defining-pipelines)
We can use CLI or ´dvc.yaml´ file.
